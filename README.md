# 📊 Data Analysis WarmUp – Pandas Project

This project is a **beginner-friendly Pandas practice dataset** where I performed common data analysis operations using Python and Pandas. The main aim of this project is to strengthen my understanding of **basic DataFrame operations** that are frequently used in real-world data analysis.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains **student information** with the following columns:

* **Name** – Student Name
* **Marks** – Marks obtained by the student
* **Gender** – Gender of the student

**Dataset Size:**

* Total Rows: **30**
* Total Columns: **3**

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* Jupyter Notebook

---

## ✅ Operations Performed

Below are the Pandas operations performed on the dataset:

1. Displayed **Top 3 rows** of the dataset using `head()`
2. Displayed **Last 3 rows** of the dataset using `tail()`
3. Found the **shape of the dataset** (number of rows & columns)
4. Retrieved dataset information such as:

   * Total number of rows
   * Total number of columns
   * Data type of each column
   * Memory usage
5. Checked **null values** in the dataset
6. Generated **overall statistics** using `describe()`
7. Found **unique values** from the Gender column
8. Calculated the **number of unique values** in the Gender column
9. Displayed **count of each unique value** in the Gender column
10. Found the **total number of students** having marks between **90 and 100 (inclusive)** using the `between()` method
11. Applied custom logic using the **`apply()` method**
12. Used the **`map()` function** for value transformation
13. Sorted the DataFrame based on the **Marks column**
14. Displayed **Name and Marks of Female students only**
